Backlog:
2. refactor code -> put functions to .utils files
BUG: when P10 is reached, player ActualPhase changes to text value -> phase desc generation on the user card fails.


WIP:
1. undo previous round submit (in case round completed/points were mistakenly recorded)

add prevXYZ values to state 
player: actual phase, totalPoints - ADDED. Values to reset: completedGame: false, phaseCompleted: false, roundPoints: 0
game: givesCard - ADDED. Values to reset: count: count-1, completed: false

rollback button shall be disabled when it is pressed




Done:
3. develop final user path / screens
5. add winner badge at endOfGame
4. routing between screens (welcome / add player / playgame)
